# pandas-challenge

In the PyCitySchools folder we have PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb. This is the jupyter notebook that will be the main scrip to run the analysis.
We also have the schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv in the resources folder with the files to load and read into Pandas DataFrames.
